This is a c++ program which will help you find all the four opertion of sets. by the four operations i mean the mathematical sets
operations that is:
1.Union of sets in c++
2.Intersection of sets in c++
3.Complement of sets in c++
4.Difference of two sets in c++

This is my first semester work when we were given an assignment to write a c++ program that should find all the operations on sets.
This was my first time to solve a real world problem. 

i came of with this solution. I know is not that a rocket science and it is very simple and easy. 
Another point here is that this was my first ever assignment there is always a room for the 
improvements. 

You can do better then that. 
Thanks.

one last point is that i do have created videos where i have discussed every single line of this program. 
if you are interested then i will leave a link to these videos.
